Learning Objectives

After reading, you should be able to:

Understand the difference between one-, two- and n-dimensional arrays in NumPy;

Understand how to apply some linear algebra operations to n-dimensional arrays without using for-loops;

Understand axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays.
------------------------
-> NumPyâ€™s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array.
 It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type,
 indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers.
 In NumPy dimensions are called axes.
